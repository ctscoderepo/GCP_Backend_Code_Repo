This is another very good looking concept, iCam is the vision of Italian designer Antonio DeRosa, the idea is to have a device that attaches to the iPhone 5, which then allows the user to have a camera with interchangeable lenses. The device would also feature a front-touch screen and a projector. Would be great if apple picked up on this and made it reality.</p>",
